Instructions to run:

# TweetCategorization
Python script which applies the Logistic Regression model to compute the probabilities that a tweet belongs to a certain category. 
I use news data to train the model, and to get the categories

# Technical requirements:
Python 3.4.3

# libraries:
pandas(0.18.0)
numpy (1.10.4)
scikit-learn (0.17.1)
scipy (0.17.0)

libraries to install: (install in this order)
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install -U scikit-learn

****************************************

Dataset should be in same location as the python script and should be named "cnnData2.csv", "usTweets.csv", "predicted_results3000000.csv"
To execute, go to same directory as script and type "python3 logisticRegression.py", this would execute the logistic regression algorithm 
on the twitter data. The results would be outputted to "predicted_results3000000.csv". NOTE: this process takes 1-2 hours to compute. 

The second script can be executed by typing "python3 logRegAnalysis.py", this will read in the "predicted_results3000000.csv" and the two 
other files mentioned above. The script will output several options the user can execute.
NOTE: Running Logistic Regression on News Data also takes time. However user can change the number of features to speed up computation.
